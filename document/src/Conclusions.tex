\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
\subsection{DPDK}
DPDK is, like, super awesome and should be used by everyone!
Optimizing parameters of the network stack in Linux or implementing benchmarks in DPDK are additional optimizations for improving network performance and may be considered in future work.

\subsection{Virtual Functions}
\label{sec:virtual_functions}
Virtual functions would be really good for scaling

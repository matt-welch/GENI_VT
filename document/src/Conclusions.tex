\chapter{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Virtual systems including virtual machines and containers are commonly chosen for use in the enterprise and greater network due to their flexibility and cost effectiveness.

Bridging was shown to have more variability and lower throughput than the physical network connections.  
This paradigm is concerning for large numbers of guests because any networking paradigm that requires host kernel involvement cannot scale to a large number of guests without a performance impact.
This is because the work required by the host to monitor and handle bridge traffic and layer 3 decisions for multiple guests can be significant and induces additional latency for each guest added to the bridge.    

\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future_work}
\subsection{DPDK}
DPDK can allow ssytems to avoid any interference by the kernel by removing the interfaces from the kernel domain and using poll mode userspace drivers to minimize response latency.  
Optimizing parameters of the network stack in Linux or implementing benchmarks in DPDK are additional optimizations for improving network performance and may be considered in future work.

\subsection{Virtual Functions}
\label{sec:virtual_functions}
Virtual functions are a mechanism by which physical devices may be multiplexed and share their resources among many virtual devices.  
A virtual function for a network interface card, for example, is composed of one pair of transmit and receive queues of the 64 available in the physical device.

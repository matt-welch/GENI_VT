Network workloads have been increasingly migrating to virtual environments.
Tuning in comparisons among virtual systems has often ignored significant performance gains that can be had with simple modifications to hypervisor and host systems.
In this study, containers and virtual machines are analyzed for their network performance with a standard modern kernel and a preempt-rt variant of the same kernel with additional tuning and isolation enabled.  
This shows that some performance gains can be had by utilizing existing systems and minimizing interference from the host system.

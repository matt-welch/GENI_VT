Usage: ./app/app/x86_64-native-linuxapp-gcc/pktgen -c COREMASK|-l CORELIST -n CHANNELS [options]

EAL common options:
  -c COREMASK         Hexadecimal bitmask of cores to run on
  -l CORELIST         List of cores to run on
                      The argument format is <c1>[-c2][,c3[-c4],...]
                      where c1, c2, etc are core indexes between 0 and 128
  --lcores COREMAP    Map lcore set to physical cpu set
                      The argument format is
                            '<lcores[@cpus]>[<,lcores[@cpus]>...]'
                      lcores and cpus list are grouped by '(' and ')'
                      Within the group, '-' is used for range separator,
                      ',' is used for single number separator.
                      '( )' can be omitted for single element group,
                      '@' can be omitted if cpus and lcores have the same value
  --master-lcore ID   Core ID that is used as master
  -n CHANNELS         Number of memory channels
  -m MB               Memory to allocate (see also --socket-mem)
  -r RANKS            Force number of memory ranks (don't detect)
  -b, --pci-blacklist Add a PCI device in black list.
                      Prevent EAL from using this PCI device. The argument
                      format is <domain:bus:devid.func>.
  -w, --pci-whitelist Add a PCI device in white list.
                      Only use the specified PCI devices. The argument format
                      is <[domain:]bus:devid.func>. This option can be present
                      several times (once per device).
                      [NOTE: PCI whitelist cannot be used with -b option]
  --vdev              Add a virtual device.
                      The argument format is <driver><id>[,key=val,...]
                      (ex: --vdev=eth_pcap0,iface=eth2).
  --vmware-tsc-map    Use VMware TSC map instead of native RDTSC
  --proc-type         Type of this process (primary|secondary|auto)
  --syslog            Set syslog facility
  --log-level         Set default log level

  --no-shconf         No shared config (mmap'd files)

EAL Linux options:
  -d LIB.so           Add driver (can be used multiple times)
  --socket-mem        Memory to allocate on sockets (comma separated values)
  --huge-dir          Directory where hugetlbfs is mounted
  --file-prefix       Prefix for hugepage filenames
  --base-virtaddr     Base virtual address
  --create-uio-dev    Create /dev/uioX (usually done by hotplug)
  --vfio-intr         Interrupt mode for VFIO (legacy|msi|msix)
  --xen-dom0          Support running on Xen dom0 without hugetlbfs

===== Application Usage =====

  -l filename  Write log to filename
  -P           Enable PROMISCUOUS mode on all ports
  -g address   Optional IP address and port number default is (localhost:0x5606)

      BTW: you can use "{}" instead of "[]" as it does not matter to the syntax.
  -h           Display the help information

[JMW] BTW, don't use [] or {} at all when making the mapping string - they don't work!!!
For example: 
this does not produce the 5-core to T,port0-rx,port0-tx,port1-rx,port1-tx mapping
    -m "{2:3}.0, {4:5}.1"

but this does
    -m "2:3.0, 4:5.1"

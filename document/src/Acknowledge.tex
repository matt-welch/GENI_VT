I would like to express my sincere appreciation for my thesis advisor, Dr. Violet Syrotiuk for her support and confidence in me throughout the classes and research.
It's truly rare to find professors that take such keen interest in the success of their students and, for that, I am eternally grateful.

Thank you to both of my committee members, Dr. Carole-Jean Wu and Dr. Gil Speyer, who are both great professors and have inspired me to study networking and architecture. 

Thank you to Valerie Young, Shrikant Shah, and Scott Oehrlein who have mentored me at various points during the last three years and inspired me to keep studying.

My deep appreciation also goes out to the rest of the crew in the lab for keeping me on my toes and accepting me unconditionally.

And a final thanks to my old friend and mentor, Dr. Kevin Hazen, who taught me that the precision and accuracy of the work are important, but different doesn't necessarily mean wrong.

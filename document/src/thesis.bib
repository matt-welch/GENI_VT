In this paper, we explore the performance of traditional virtual machine (VM) deployments, and contrast them with the use of {L}inux containers. We use KVM as a representative hypervisor and Docker as a container manager. Our results show that containers result in equal or better performance than VMs in almost all cases. Both VMs and containers require tuning to support I/Ointensive applications. We also discuss the implications of our performance results for future cloud architectures.},
